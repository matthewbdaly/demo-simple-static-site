    <p>OK, this subject has been done to death, but Internet Explorer 6 needs to die. It&#39;s old, it&#39;s dated, it&#39;s insecure, it&#39;s not standards compliant, it requires web designers and developers to spend countless hours adjusting perfectly standards-compliant websites to render correctly in IE6 when they could be adding cool new features. You know the drill by now!</p>
<p>So, how do we get people to dump IE6? I think Microsoft have probably done everything reasonable to get people to move to IE7 or IE8, but a hard core of users just won&#39;t budge. By and large these users fall into the following groups:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Corporate users </strong>- that is, people using IE6 on their desktops at work. It&#39;s well known that IE6 usage drops substantially at weekends so this probably represents a lot of people. Where I work we&#39;re still on Internet Explorer 6, but the reason for that is that we use a lot of custom web applications which were designed specifically for IE6, and if they changed browsers they&#39;d have to convert these web apps to be standards-compliant. One day they&#39;ll have to update them, but there&#39;s no sign of that happening anytime soon. It&#39;s not the user&#39;s fault (there are many, many posts on the intranet forums at work bemoaning the fact we&#39;re still stuck with IE6) and most of them would rather use a better browser at work since there are a number of very useful web applications which IE6 works terribly with (Google Maps is a good example).</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>People who don&#39;t know any better and don&#39;t see the need to upgrade - </strong>this might include the elderly or other non-computer savvy people who&#39;ve disabled Windows updates for some reason (maybe because they find it makes things slower).</li>
</ol>
<p>But why are we letting these groups hold the whole future of the web back? By bending over backwards to support these people, we&#39;re prolonging IE6&#39;s shelf life, and making it easy for people to continue IE6 when we really don&#39;t want them to! It&#39;s simple to upgrade your browser or switch to a new one, so why are we propping up a minority who can&#39;t be bothered?</p>
<p>I&#39;m beginning to think that we ought to draw a parallel with digital television. In many countries, the digital and analogue signals have been coexisting for some time, and now we&#39;ve begun switching off the analogue signal. We aren&#39;t bending over backwards to support people who haven&#39;t got a digital television or Freeview box yet - if you haven&#39;t got one when they switch off the signal, you&#39;re going to be watching a blank screen. With web browsers, we don&#39;t expect people to make any financial outlay - we just want them to click on a link, so I think it&#39;s much more reasonable to cut them off from our content unless they switch browsers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&#39;s the decision of the person who wants to make a website whether or not to support IE6, but I think we need to be a little harsher than we have in the past. Google are beginning to drop IE6 support, and I&#39;m sure more people will follow. By catering for the remaining IE6 users, we may well be prolonging its usage, and perhaps we need a big stick to encourage users to switch to a newer browser. Of course it&#39;s a difficult decision to make if you&#39;re hoping to attract customers to a commercial website since if website A and website B both sell the same product but the customer&#39;s browser doesn&#39;t work on website A, he&#39;s going to go to website B instead.</p>
