  <section>
    <p>I&#39;ve had my Dell Inspiron since 2004, and it&#39;s worked very, very well for me (it&#39;s still going strong), but I can&#39;t deny that it&#39;s too slow and old for many modern operating systems. I&#39;ve been running Kubuntu Hardy on it for a while as that was the last version which shipped with KDE3.x but I was feeling the pain of running an older release, so I started hunting around for a replacement. KDE4 is just too heavy for this computer, so that wasn&#39;t an option.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried a number of Ubuntu derivatives, including CrunchBang Linux and Xubuntu, but Xubuntu was too slow and I didn&#39;t really get on too well with CrunchBang (too basic for my liking). What I really wanted was a fairly default XFCE desktop (I really like the base XFCE desktop and it&#39;s not as bloated as Gnome or KDE).</p>
<p>Unable to find an Ubuntu derivative that really met my requirements, I decided to look elsewhere. I was considering Debian with XFCE as I have had a lot of good experiences with Debian-based distros outside Ubuntu, including sidux and SimplyMEPIS, but I felt like a little distro-hopping as I haven&#39;t done that for a while (since my trusty Philips X58 died at Christmas time I&#39;ve only had one Linux machine, that being the old Dell, so I&#39;ve relied on my MacBook a lot).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve always been interested in the sound of Slackware, and I had a copy of Slackware 13 that came with Linux Magazine, so I thought I&#39;d give that a go. I&#39;m familiar with the installer so the only issues I was likely to have were with configuring my wireless network. Fortunately, Slackware nowadays ships with wicd included on the disc, and I&#39;m familiar with this. Once I&#39;d finished the install (not hard by any means, just more involved than, for example, Ubuntu&#39;s installer), I booted it up and installed wicd from the DVD, and it worked straight away.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve heard that Slackware has a lot less bloat than most other Linux distros, and my experience certainly bears that out. Compared to Xubuntu, my new Slackware install with XFCE is lightning-fast. As of right now I&#39;m running slackpkg to update my system and while it may not be as flexible and powerful as apt, and not have a nice graphical front-end, it&#39;s perfectly usable and I&#39;m happy with it. I&#39;m used to sudo from both Ubuntu and OS X so I&#39;ve set that up, and all in all I&#39;m very pleased with my new system.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll let you know how I get on with it over time, but for now I think Slackware is a great distro for what I want on this machine, and one that&#39;ll help me learn more about Linux. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still love Ubuntu, but Slack has its place too, and I have my own reasons for liking both.</p>
