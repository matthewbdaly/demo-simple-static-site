    <p>For a while now I&#39;ve been considering setting up a website on my own domain name, as this would provide an excellent way of showcasing my abilities with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and provide a URL I can put on my CV when applying for jobs. I&#39;ve had my eye on the domain name matthewdaly.co.uk, and last night I bought the bullet and paid for it (bargain at about Â£6 for 2 years, including VAT).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve wanted to put a blog on there, but I couldn&#39;t find a blogging engine that I could easily integrate into it. I was thinking that the way to go would be to write a custom blogging app using Django, but right now I really don&#39;t have time to sit down and learn Django properly, what with doing an unrelated day job and studying in my spare time. So, I thought rather than put it off, I&#39;ll get some free web hosting and put something on there now, even if it&#39;s fairly basic.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.matthewdaly.co.uk">here</a> it is! Please feel free to have a play around with it and let me know what you think, or any problems you&#39;ve had with it. I&#39;ve used a little CSS3 in making it, partly because it was by far the easiest way to implement drop shadows and rounded corners, but it degrades fairly gracefully in browsers that don&#39;t support CSS3 yet. I didn&#39;t have too many problems with adjusting for IE6 thanks to the reset style sheet I used, and the <a href="http://www.twinhelix.com/css/iepngfix/">PNG fix</a>.</p>
<p>In future I will expand upon this fairly basic site (and naturally I&#39;m going to have to stump up for paid hosting in future) but for now this is my first hand-coded website!</p>
