    <p>Unless you live in the southern hemisphere, summer&#39;s here. Right now it&#39;s gone midnight but it&#39;s still very hot, and being in the UK, where home air conditioning is not common, there&#39;s little way to alleviate the heat besides opening the window (which you don&#39;t want to do because people are continually having barbecues).</p>
<p>I have to admit to just not being a summer person - I don&#39;t really like hot weather or outdoor pursuits in general. I&#39;m happier in spring and autumn when it&#39;s cool, but not cold, and I can wear my favourite Animal hoodie if it does turn chillier. When it gets hot I find it extremely difficult to get anything done unless I can do so in a fully air-conditioned environment, and have a lot of trouble sleeping at night, exacerbating the problem due to tiredness. Unfortunately, I&#39;m now having to learn Perl from scratch during this time (a fairly daunting prospect at the best of times!), and it&#39;s a bit of a nightmare trying to actually sit down and learn regular expressions properly when it&#39;s hot and stuffy and you can&#39;t think straight.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll have to try going to a nice cool air-conditioned cafe with my Dell Mini, get a cold drink and see if I can get some work done that way. But I&#39;m curious to know if anyone else has any good tips for remaining productive at learning a new programming language during hot weather that they&#39;d like to pass on?</p>
