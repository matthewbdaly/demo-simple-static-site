    <p>I bought my MacBook two years ago, and at first I was cynical about how I would find it compared to Ubuntu, but over time I found myself using it more and more. While I have never considered myself a Mac user (I&#39;ve always thought of myself as a Linux user who owns a Mac), I did grow to appreciate the combination of a solid Unix base with a well thought-out GUI, and it worked out well for me.</p>
<p>Yet now I&#39;m finding myself slowly moving back to Linux. I&#39;m running Slackware 13.1 on an old Inspiron I&#39;ve had since 2004, and my recently purchased Dell Studio 15 dual-boots Windows 7 and Ubuntu. But the one I&#39;m using by far the most is my Mini Inspiron, which dual-boots Windows XP and Ubuntu Netbook Edition, and XP almost never gets used.</p>
<p>Part of the reason is that the Mini itself is just such a handy machine to have around - it&#39;s small enough to be portable, and it&#39;s convenient to use it anywhere at home too, but at the same time it&#39;s big enough to use without any issues (which is more than I can say about my old Eee PC, which has now been passed on to my sister). OK, not everyone likes Dell&#39;s products, but I&#39;ve always found them to be very good value basic computers, and they really have gotten the whole netbook idea and produced an excellent product.</p>
<p>Also, Ubuntu Netbook Edition is really great - the newly revamped user interface works really well on the netbook form factor, and it&#39;s an excellent experience for the most part. Performance is more than acceptable, and most applications start very quickly (Chrome is noticeably faster than on OS X).</p>
<p>But the thing that I&#39;m really starting to appreciate more than anything else is just how much more powerful and flexible it is under the bonnet than OS X. For starters, a package manager like apt-get makes it incredibly easy to install new software. In particular, this is useful for installing useful Python modules, as so far as I&#39;m aware Python doesn&#39;t have anything like Perl&#39;s CPAN or Ruby&#39;s rubygem system. Yes, I guess I could use MacPorts or something like that, but personally I&#39;ve never liked the idea of installing a new package manager yourself rather than using one that&#39;s a fundamental part of the OS.</p>
<p>This also means I have to compile many Python modules from source on OS X. This has taught me an interesting lesson about usability - namely that it&#39;s not an absolute. For many tasks Ubuntu is actually considerably easier to use than OS X, since Synaptic offers users the opportunity to install a lot of software from a GUI that on OS X would need to be compiled from source, although for installation of desktop applications OS X is probably marginally easier.</p>
<p>Also, byobu is an excellent tool - it really helps to make GNU screen more useful and accessible. I have it set up to launch screen in any new terminal sessions and I&#39;m beginning to wonder how I ever coped without it.</p>
<p>Finally, Snow Leopard seems to have broken a lot of things I liked in OS X. I used to use the Terminator terminal emulator in Leopard and it worked well, but in Snow Leopard, Spotlight can&#39;t find it (I think it&#39;s something to do with the Java bridge being deprecated, as Terminator is written in Java), so I had to change to iTerm instead, which I don&#39;t like so much. Snow Leopard also seems to refuse to open browser bookmarks via Spotlight in anything but Safari, which really gets on my nerves as I hate Safari.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not planning to get rid of my MacBook anytime soon, but I am increasingly finding it&#39;s less appropriate to my needs, less productive, and less powerful compared to Ubuntu.</p>
