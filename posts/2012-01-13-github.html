    <p>To date, Subversion is the single versioning system I have the most experience with. I use it at work, and I was already somewhat familiar with it beforehand. However, with all the buzz over Git over the last few years, it&#39;s always been tempting to explore that as an alternative.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve had a Github account for over a year, but had as yet not added anything to it. However, today that changed. I&#39;ve had a rather haphazard approch towards my .vimrc and other Vim configuration files for a while, with the result that they tend to be less than consistent across different machines. I&#39;ve seen that a fair number of people put their Vim configuration files under version control, and that seemed like an effective solution, so I&#39;ve gotten my .vimrc and .vim into a respectable state and added them to <a href="https://github.com/matthewbdaly/My-vim-configuration">a new repository</a>. Now I should have no excuse for letting them get out of sync.</p>
<p>I have to say, Github is a truly wonderful service. The tutorials for getting started with Git are really good, and make it easy to get started. It&#39;s probably one of the main reasons why Git is becoming more and more popular- there isn&#39;t really anything comparable for Subversion.</p>
