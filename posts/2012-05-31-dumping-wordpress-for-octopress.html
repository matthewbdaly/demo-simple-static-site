    <p>Lately I&#39;ve gotten more and more fed up with WordPress as a blogging platform. It&#39;s certainly a great content management system, and for non-technical bloggers it&#39;s absolutely perfect, but I&#39;ve been increasingly finding myself hitting barriers that make it harder than it should be to get stuff done. It&#39;s just not the best platform for blogging about web development.</p>
<p>Take my recent series of Django tutorials, for example. You wouldn&#39;t believe the amount of time I spent trying to format some of the code properly in TinyMCE for those. Furthermore, the end result, even though the theme was a custom one I&#39;d built myself that was somewhat optimised for showing off code, wasn&#39;t exactly great.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Markdown is a far better option for writing blog posts in than using a rich text editor like TinyMCE. You normally have a pretty good idea what the end results will look like, and it&#39;s generally well-formatted HTML. Also, it means I can easily write my blog posts in Vim.</p>
<p>Octopress was therefore an obvious choice. It&#39;s absolutely brilliant for sharing code - compared to WordPress, code samples look <em>stunning</em>. Also, because it generates static HTML, it loads an awful lot faster than WordPress does, and the default theme is extremely nice. So that&#39;s what I&#39;ve gone for.</p>
<p>The only issue is that my web host are a bit funny about offering SSH access, so I&#39;ve resorted to FTP-ing the files across, which isn&#39;t ideal. Still, it&#39;s not that big an issue, and I&#39;ll have to see how it goes with Octopress. I do have a low-end VPS I could point this domain name at instead and run it from there if necessary, so I can always resort to that if this is too cumbersome.</p>
