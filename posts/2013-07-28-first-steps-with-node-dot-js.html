    <p>The idea of building an entire web app using nothing but JavaScript has always appealed to me. Despite its undoubted flaws, JavaScript is a powerful language, and chopping and changing between several different programming languages is never great. So I&#39;ve always wanted to check out Node.js.</p>
<p>Lately I&#39;ve been tinkering with Backbone.js a lot. As a web and mobile app developer, I&#39;ve seen the benefit of server-side MVC frameworks firsthand, and I&#39;ve also seen how bad a PhoneGap app can get without this kind of structure, so I&#39;ve been very eager for a while to get my head around a JavaScript framework. The first one I was able to really grok was Knockout.js, thanks to its wonderful tutorial, but Backbone.js seemed to have better mindshare, and support for routing, so I knuckled down and used it for a large personal project that is still under wraps, but I hope to make available once complete. Using Backbone has made my client-side code far more organised, and I plan to use it a lot in future.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also wanted to get my head around a couple of the NoSQL databases. While the relational model is very often applicable, there are plenty of use cases where it isn&#39;t the best choice, especially for simple data, and MongoDB seemed to be an interesting alternative. So, I decided to have a tinker around with Node.js and Backbone today, and wound up building <a href="https://github.com/matthewbdaly/rabbitrabbitrabbit">a real-time guestbook application</a>. Let me know what you think, but please be gentle - this is my first ever Node.js or MongoDB application.</p>
