    <h1><a href="/posts/2014-10-19-my-django-web-server-setup.html">My Django web server setup</a></h1>
  </div>
  <section>
    <p>This isn&#39;t really part of my Django tutorial series (that has now definitely concluded!), but I thought I&#39;d share the setup I generally use for deploying Django applications, partly for my own reference, and partly because it is quite complex, and those readers who don&#39;t wish to deploy to Heroku may want some guidance on how to deploy their new blogs to a VPS.</p>
<h2 id="operating-system">Operating system</h2>
<p>This isn&#39;t actually that much of a big deal, but while I prefer Ubuntu on desktops, I generally use Debian Stable on servers, since it&#39;s fanatically stable.</p>
<h2 id="database-server">Database server</h2>
<p>For my first commercial Django app, I used MySQL. However, South had one or two issues with MySQL, and I figured that since using an ORM and migrations meant that I wouldn&#39;t need to write much SQL anyway, I might as well jump to PostgreSQL for the Django app I&#39;m currently in the process of deploying at work. So far I haven&#39;t had any problems with it.</p>
<h2 id="web-server">Web server</h2>
<p>It&#39;s customary to use two web servers with Django. One handles the static content, and reverse proxies everything else to a different port, where another web server serves the dynamic content.</p>
<p>For serving the static files, I use Nginx - it&#39;s generally considered to be faster than Apache for this use case. Here&#39;s a typical Nginx config file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    client_max_body_size 50M;

    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;

    location /static {
        root /var/www/mysite;
    }

    location /media {
        root /var/www/mysite;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>For the application server, I use Gunicorn. You can install this with <code>pip install gunicorn</code>, then add it to <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code>. Then add the following config file to the root of your project:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">bind = <span class="string">"127.0.0.1:8000"</span>
logfile = <span class="string">"/var/log/gunicorn.log"</span>
loglevel = <span class="string">"debug"</span>
workers = <span class="number">3</span></code></pre>
<p>You should normally set the number of workers to 2 times the number of cores on your machine, plus one.</p>
<p>In order to keep Gunicorn running, I use Supervisor. As the installation commands will depend on your OS, I won&#39;t give details here - your package manager of choice should have a suitable package available. Here&#39;s a typical Supervisor config file I might use for running Gunicorn for a Django app:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">[program:mysite]
command=/var/www/mysite/venv/bin/gunicorn myapp.wsgi:application --workers=3
directory=/var/www/mysite/
user=nobody
autostart=<span class="literal">true</span>
autorestart=<span class="literal">true</span></code></pre>
<p>Once that&#39;s in place, you can easily add the new app:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">sudo supervisorctl reread
sudo supervisorctl update</code></pre>
<p>Then to start it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">sudo supervisorctl start mysite</code></pre>
<p>Or stop it with:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">sudo supervisorctl stop mysite</code></pre>
<p>Or restart it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">sudo supervisorctl restart mysite</code></pre>
<h2 id="celery">Celery</h2>
<p>So far, both of the web apps I&#39;ve built professionally have been ones where it made sense to use <a href="http://www.celeryproject.org/">Celery</a> for some tasks. For the uninitiated, Celery lets you pass a task to a queue to be handled, rather than handling it within the context of the same HTTP request. This offers the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user doesn&#39;t need to wait for the task to be completed before getting a response, improving performance</li>
<li>It&#39;s more robust, since if the task fails, it can be automatically retried</li>
<li>The task queue can be moved to another server if desired, making it easier to scale</li>
<li>Scheduling tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve used it in cases where I needed to send an email or a push notification, since these don&#39;t have to be done within the context of the same HTTP request, but need to be reliable.</p>
<p>I generally use RabbitMQ as my message queue. I&#39;ll leave setting this up as an exercise for the reader since it&#39;s covered pretty well in the Celery documentation, but like with Gunicorn, I use Supervisor to run the Celery worker. Here&#39;s a typical config file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">[program:celeryd]
command=/var/www/mysite/venv/bin/python manage.py celery worker
directory=/var/www/mysite/
user=nobody
autostart=<span class="literal">true</span>
autorestart=<span class="literal">true</span></code></pre>
<p>Then start it up:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">sudo supervisorctl reread
sudo supervisorctl update
sudo supervisorctl start celeryd</code></pre>
<p>I make no claims about how good this setup is, but it works well for me. I haven&#39;t yet had the occasion to deploy a Django app to anywhere other than Heroku that really benefited from caching, so I haven&#39;t got any tips to share about that, but if I were building a content-driven web app, I would use Memcached since it&#39;s well-supported.</p>
